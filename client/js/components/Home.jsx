      This Starter app is ugly on purpose.
      Your CSS preprocessor, framework, and architecture is up to you, so this starter/boilerplate lets you implement the one you want, rather than making you excise the one that I put in.
      This allows for more flexibility in implementation, because the styling solution may change from project to project, and it future-prooofs the starter/boilerplate a bit more.
    </p>
    <p>
      That said, there is a bit of architecture in the javascript code, however, it is only there as an example of how routing, actions, action creators, and reducers work for those new to React and Redux,
      and how to build a basic API
    </p>
  </div>
);

export default Home;
